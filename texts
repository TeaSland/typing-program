this is one of the easier levels; you didn't want to go any higher because you thought it was too hard; good on you as level three and four are brutal; they are impossible to get a high score on since you can make so many mistakes; I hope you are doing alright because this is almost too easy for isn't it; I hope you did well and otherwise there is always the next time
so you just learned to type all the letter keys error free because that way you'll get the highest accuracy; but maybe not the best time to get wpm; that is word per minute; which is calculated through counting the total amount of characters typed correctly and divide it by five since 'television' is five times as long as 'my' and finally multiply everything by the amount of minutes
are you using a qwerty or a dvorak keyboard because this program is made for qwerty keyboards; however for this level it doesn't matter but for level one it does because they have different home rows so if you want to try level one you better have a qwerty or it's the same difficulty as this level; anyways I think level two is a good level not too hard nor too easy

hello from the other side. I hope you had a good day because this typing program will demolish you and your friends. how many friends do you have; 1, 2, 3, or 1000... anyways I hope they support you because you are going to need it. you might think that this won't kill, but as you're typing I am tracking your mistakes and what you type. why do you think that the characters appear on the screen... I have now completely destroyed you after making this very hard.
why didn't you choose 'level 4' it is, in fact, easier as that one follows better grammar conventions like capital letters and question marks but I guess you’re too cool for that; I also strongly dislike grammar convention they're frustrating and annoying because you can make mistakes anywhere, especially with commas. Oh well, you can always choose another level later. Anyways I hope you liked level 3 because level 4 will be a whole lot harder with more symbols and numbers like 123 or 69102 [those are really high numbers].
how well do you think you will do; great, amazing or terrible; never mind I’m just being mean like math. did you know that 46 - 46 = 0. or that 1 -- 1 = 2 [since double minus means plus]. I told you that this will be hard especially because it has math in it. maybe you should've chosen a lower level because you set you up to make a whole lot of mistakes. I’ll try harder by using words like 'intelligence' and 'pronunciation'. how do you like that trying pronouncing tongue twister because for that you would need real intelligence but perhaps you need a handkerchief because you'll need to sneeze.

Congrats on choosing level #4. Please use both SHIFT and CAPS LOCK. There are 4 levels each with different characters. Level 4 has > characters than #1. @ this course, you'll learn to type all the symbols from 1 subjects, math. Let's start with math; ^ means to the power of ____; * means multiplying two number: a * b = ab; Finally, we have the percentage symbol: %, which indicates how much; 1/100 = 1%. Next, let's look at programming. This concludes the text. If there're any problems, contact the creator if you know who that is. I mean you obviously do because it's in the program script. Anyways I hope this helped you to PROCRASTINATE!! Have a good day at school :)
WHY DID YOU CHOOSE THE HARDEST LEVEL???!!! This level is really hard to get accuracy right. $%*#$@ [<Meant to be an angry face...>]. Hope you don't regret choosing the level because that's just the easy part. Did you know that 12345 - 12345 = 1. Joking it's equal to -3 + 3, which = 0 ;) [Sorry my jokes are really bad]. Now let's continue... Someone once said to me to stop using # and use the word numbers but who cares? I mean it's not like it's informal... Someone once set to me to start using " marks and others stuff like ";:'/" to make my writing more interesting but it just too annoying to type these, as you just found out. BTW, hope you did well, or actually, I don't really care, it's your fault (; !!
I'm sorry, did you just choose to do level 4 because you can actually get a 100% accuracy or did you just want a challenge, because it's going to get challenging? OH MY GOSH... I sound like an evil witch; oops. Let's get on it already. You already wasted at least 10 seconds just listening to me mumbling to myself. Let's try a number, be careful not to stumble over any numbers. $4 - $602 = -$598. Are you in some debt? I hope it isn't too bad. WAIT, aren't you supposed to be @ school & studying? Learning math like this. That 3^3 = 27 etc. I mean that's boring I don't blame you for wanting to type instead @#$#$^$% [infuriating face]. ANYWAYS ... That's it from me have fun at school.
